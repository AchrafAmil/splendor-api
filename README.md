Kotlin library providing an API to play _Splendor_, the board game.

Useful for experimentation with different strategies/tactics or as a core engine wrapped in a graphical app.

Basically, you create a new game by instantiating an new `Game` and registering each player's implementation of the interface `Player`.
Then you start the game by calling `game.start(gameCallback)`.

Provide a `GameCallback` to get notified while the game is going on (on start, on turn, on end, etc).

Please note that `Game::start` is a blocking method that will only return once the game is finished.

The library do respect the same conventional game rules, for more details please refer to Splendor's Rulebook.

## How-to
First add dependency to your `build.gradle`.
```Groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    ...
}
```

```Groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "com.github.achrafamil:splendor-api:1.0.1"
}
```

### Implement your players
Define your own player or use one of the ready-to-use implementations defined in `/players`. For convenience those are named `Joe`, `Ryan`, `Johanna`... and do all extend `BasicPlayer`. Refer to their documentation for more details on their strategies.

You can either build your player from scratch by implementing `Player` interface or you can just extend `BasicPlayer` and override desired behavior.

`Player` interface requires two methods :
```kotlin

class MyPlayer() : Player {
    // give it a unique name
    override val name: String = "My player"

    override fun playTurn(
        opponentsStates: List<PlayerState>,
        selfState: PlayerState,
        boardState: BoardState
    ): Transaction {
        TODO("decide what to do with your turn and return your decision i.e. a transaction")
    }

    override fun chooseNoble(
        affordableNobles: List<Noble>,
        opponentsStates: List<PlayerState>,
        selfState: PlayerState,
        boardState: BoardState
    ): Noble {
        TODO("you're eligible for picking one noble, return your choice from $affordableNobles")
    }
}
```

#### Each turn's decision
Your player will be asked each turn to decide for a `Transaction`.
`Transaction` is a sealed class with 3 possible implementations :
- `TokensExchange` : you decide to collect tokens during this turn.
Negative values are allowed as far as they represent giving up some tokens.

    Valid `Transaction.TokensExchange` examples:
```kotlin
TokensExchange(colorMap(white = 1, green = 1, black = 1) // as long as user has < 8 tokens
TokensExchange(colorMap(white = 1, green = 1) // as long as user has < 9 tokens
TokensExchange(colorMap(white = 2) // as long as user has < 9 tokens
TokensExchange(colorMap(white = 1, green = 1, black = 1, red = -2) // as long as user has < 10 tokens
```
   More examples can be found in unit tests.

- `CardBuying` : you decide to exchange some of your tokens for a card in the board. You should reference one of the available cards in `boardState`.
- `CardReservation` : you book a card and get a golden token.

All in all your transaction should respect the game rules, please refer to Splendor's Rulebook.
If your player returns a transaction violating rules (eg. `TokensExchange` with 4 tokens or `CardBuying` without enough tokens...) the `Game` will throw an `IllegalTransactionException`.

So make sure your transaction does respect the rules by calling :
```kotlin
boardState.playerCanSubmitTransaction(selfState, myTransaction)
```

## Ready-to-use AI players
Some ready to use implementations of `Player` interface are provided inside `.players` subpackage.

Following are their respective strategies in a nutshell :

- *Joe*: I buy the best card I can afford, otherwise I collect the _3 most-needed_ important tokens.
- *Eve*: Will always try to _prevent opponent_ from getting their most interesting cards.
- *Ryan*: Makes _random choices_ when it comes to choosing which tokens to collect.
- *Johanna*: Like Joe but Johanna interest in cards is also _influenced by nobles_ in the game.

When played together in one-vs-one games, players on the left column have following chances of winning :

|         | Joe | Eve | Ryan | Johanna |
|---------|-----|-----|------|---------|
| Joe     | 50% | 55% | 55%  | 36%     |
| Eve     | 45% | 50% | 58%  | 43%     |
| Ryan    | 45% | 42% | 50%  | 34%     |
| Johanna | 64% | 57% | 66%  | 50%     |

Yes, Johanna rocks and taking nobles in consideration does in some circumstances considerably improve chances of winning. Now scientifically proven :-)
